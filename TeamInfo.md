## Project Summary

Our project is a recruitment dashboard and its primary objective is to assist students in achieving their career and income goals. Students can input their academic grades from 10th grade, 12th grade, and college, as well as specialization and degree data to obtain estimated salary projections, which are derived from historical data pertaining to past students. In addition, students can select their goal salary and view the past statistics of students who reached those salary goals. The dataset has a wide range of information, including secondary and higher education performance percentages, specific Higher Secondary Education specializations, degree percentages, types of degrees obtained, MBA percentages, MBA specializations, work experience, employability test scores, placement statuses, and salary offers for placed students. To enhance the application's functionality, data visualizations can be used to help users better understand the given statistics and identify patterns important to their career advancement. By focusing on post-graduation career planning and goal-setting, the application addresses the competitive nature of recruitment based on educational qualifications, setting it apart from similar platforms.
